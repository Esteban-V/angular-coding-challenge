# Frontend Coding Challenge

Esteban Viera's submission for the SpaceDev's Front End Coding Challenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Running the back end

The back end requires Java 8, and can be run from the `backend` directory with the command `./run.sh`

If it launches correctly you should see the following in the console:

`INFO [2015-10-29 13:17:10,166] org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server: Started @2126ms`

This should expose an endpoint on the following URL:
`http://localhost:6502/application/labourstats`
