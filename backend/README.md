## Running the back end

The back end requires Java 8, and can be run from the `backend` directory with the command `./run.sh`

If it launches correctly you should see the following in the console:

`INFO [2015-10-29 13:17:10,166] org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server: Started @2126ms`

This should expose an endpoint on the following URL:
`http://localhost:6502/application/labourstats`
